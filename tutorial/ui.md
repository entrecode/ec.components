# UI Components Overview

Now that the Core classes were discussed, lets have a look at its application in the ui components.
The ui components, which lay inside the ui package are all basic angular components.
They are API agnostic, meaning they do not contain any datamanager logic (or similar).
API related components are meant to inherit from the base ui components to eliminate redundancies.
