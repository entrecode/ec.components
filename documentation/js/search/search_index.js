Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory.Use the --env=prod or --env=stag for environment builds.CAUTION: you may have to \"es2015\" in tsconfig.json / lib to make UglifyJS worksee https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2/issues/659\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via Protractor.Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via ng serve.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI README.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n

'Higher than 10m' : 'Lower than 10m'\n    },\n    fruits: {\n      label: 'Has Fruits?',\n      display: (value) => value ? 'yes' : 'no'\n    },\n  }\n})This is how you display the List instance into your template:\n\n    \n\n    \n        import {\n  Component,\n  EventEmitter,\n  Input,\n  Output,\n  TemplateRef,\n  ViewEncapsulation\n} from '@angular/core';\nimport { Collection, List, ListConfig, Selection } from '@ec.components/core';\n\n/**\n * The ListComponent will render a list containing the given items or collection.\n * */\n@Component({\n  selector: 'ec-list',\n  templateUrl: './list.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./list.component.scss'],\n  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None\n})\nexport class ListComponent {\n  /** Configuration Object for List */\n  @Input() config: ListConfig;\n  /** The visible items */\n  @Input() items: Array;\n  /** The used collection */\n  @Input() collection: Collection;\n  /** The used selection */\n  @Input() selection: Selection;\n  /** Custom cell template */\n  @Input() cellTemplate: TemplateRef;\n  /** Event emitter on item selection */\n  @Output() onSelect: EventEmitter = new EventEmitter();\n  /** The Instance of the List */\n  @Input() list: List;\n\n  /** Changing items or collection will trigger reconstructing the list with the new items.\n   * Changing the selection will reconstruct the selection */\n  ngOnChanges() {\n    if (this.items) {\n      this.list = new List(this.items, this.config);\n    } else if (this.collection) {\n      this.list = new List(this.collection.items, this.config);\n    }\n    if (!this.list) {\n      return;\n    }\n    if (!this.selection && this.list.config && !this.list.config.disableSelection) {\n      this.selection = new Selection([], this.list.config);\n    }\n  }\n\n  /** Helper function for custom cell templates.
