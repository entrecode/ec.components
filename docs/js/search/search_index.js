different transformation methods, such as:\n\nresolve: This method is used to resolve the field value from the object body.\nIt runs before all other transformation methods.\ndisplay: Transforms the resolved value to a human readable output. It is used for e.g. in list cells.\ngroup: Should return a value that is suitable for grouping multiple different values together, like in a list.\n\nExample Usage:\nconst field = new Field('name', {\n    resolve: (body) => body.value.name,\n    display: (value) => value.toUpperCase(),\n    group: (value) => value.length + ' Buchstaben',\n    sort: (value) => value.length\n    });\nconst name = field.resolve({value:{name:'bobby'}}); // 'bobby'\nfield.display(name); // => 'Bobby'\nfield.group(name); // => '5 Buchstaben'\nfield.sort(name); // => 5The above example is of course only viable to show the concept.\nWhen using the components as a whole, those methods will be called automatically from Item, List or Form.\n\n    \n\n    \n        import { FieldConfigProperty } from '../config/field-config-property.interface';\n\nexport class Field implements FieldConfigProperty {\n  /** Tells if the field is required in forms */\n  required?: boolean;\n  /** The name of the field's property */\n  property?: string;\n  /** If true, the field will not be visible anywhere */\n  hidden?: boolean;\n  /** The field's type */\n  type?: string;\n  /** The field's view */\n  view?: string;\n  /** Custom Validation function */\n  validate?: (value, field) => any;\n  /** Custom Component to display form input **/\n  input?: any;\n  /** Custom Component to display value **/\n  output?: any;\n  /** Placeholder in inputs */\n  placeholder?: string;\n  /** Label for Inputs.

// set global loader\n  }\n  globalLoader() { // When not passing a loader to .wait, the global loader (set by .use) is used.\n    this.loaderService.wait(new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 2000)));\n  }\n  localLoader() {\n    this.loaderService.wait(new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 2000)), this.localLoader);\n    // this.localLoader.wait(new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 2000)));

When all promises on the stack have been resolved, the loader is hidden. This is better than just a boolean switch because multiple loading activies do not interfere with each other.\n\n    \n\n    \n        import { Component, ElementRef, ChangeDetectionStrategy } from '@angular/core';\nimport { Collection } from '@ec.components/core';\n\n/** The ec-loader can be plugged into various components to be triggered when they load stuff.\n * https://components.entrecode.de/ui/loader?e=1\n*/\n@Component({\n  selector: 'ec-loader',\n  templateUrl: './loader.component.html',\n  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush\n})\nexport class LoaderComponent {\n  /** The current stack of loading promises.*/\n  private stack: Collection> = new Collection([]);\n  /** The loader's visibility status. */\n  private visible = false;\n  /** The timestamp of the last time a promise has been added to the stack. */\n  private timestamp;\n\n  /** Injects the host element. */\n  constructor(private host: ElementRef) {\n  }\n\n  /** Shows the loader by setting .visible to the host.

The classes that are available by default can be looked up here.\nAdvanced Usage\nYou can also use multiple ec-notifications at different places:\n\n\nA\nBAll you have to do, is pass the instance of the component that should display the notification via the host property:\nexport class MyComponent {\n  constructor(private notifications: NotificationsService) {}\n\n  emit(host) {\n      this.notifications.emit({\n        type: 'success',\n        title: 'Das ist der Notification Titel',\n        host: host\n      });\n  }\n}Hiding previous errors\nHere is an example usage of a typical success/error handling.\nIt features hiding previous notifications. We recommended you to use the WithNotifications interface for that case.\nexport class MuffinComponent implements WithNotifications {\n  /** Recent Error notification */\n  notifications: Notification[] = [];\n\nconstructor(\n    public bakery:BakeryService,\n    public notificationService: NotificationsService,\n    )\n\n  bake() {\n    this.bakery.bake().then(()=> {\n        this.notificationService.emit({\n            title: 'Muffin was baken!',\n            hide: this.notifications // this will hide all preceding notifications\n        })\n    }).catch(error=>{\n        this.notificationService.emit({\n            title: 'Error while baking',\n            sticky: true,\n            hide: this.notifications, // this will hide all preceding notifications\n            replace: this.notifications // this will replace the given array with the new notification\n        })\n    });\n  }\n}The hide option is useful to hide obsolete errors. E.g. If you successfully log in after one failiure, the sticky error notification of the first attempt will be hidden. This enables you to keep errors messages as long as they are needed.\nInstead of replace, you could also use append (see notification.component.ts for implementation).\n\n    \n\n    \n        import { Component, Input } from '@angular/core';\nimport { Collection } from '@ec.components/core';\nimport { Notification } from './notification';\nimport { NotificationsService } from './notifications.service';\n\n/** Displays any kind of Notification inside the DOM.\n * It listens on the notificationService.$emitter for notifications.\n * https://components.entrecode.de/ui/notifications?e=1\n * */\n@Component({\n  selector: 'ec-notifications',\n  templateUrl: './notifications.component.html',\n})\nexport class NotificationsComponent {\n  /** The current stack of notifications that are visible. */\n  notifications: Collection = new Collection([]);\n  /** The default time for a notification to be visible. Will be ignored if the notification itself has a time set. */\n  @Input() time: number;\n\n  /** Listens on the NotificationService and shows each notification that has this component set as host, or none at all. */\n  constructor(private notificationService: NotificationsService) {\n    this.time = this.time || this.notificationService.defaultTime;\n    this.notificationService.emitter$.subscribe((notification: Notification) => {\n      if (notification.hide) {\n        this.notifications.removeAll(notification.hide);\n      }\n      if (!notification.title && !notification.message) {\n        // console.warn('tried to emit notification without message and title', notification);\n        return;\n      }\n      if (notification.append) {\n        notification.append.push(notification);\n      }\n      if (notification.replace) {\n        notification.replace.length = 0;\n        notification.replace.push(notification);\n      }\n\n      if (!notification.host || notification.host === this) {\n        this.notifications.add(notification);\n        if (notification.sticky) {\n          if (notification.time) {\n            console.warn('notification.time is ignored because it was set sticky');\n          }\n          return;\n        }\n        setTimeout(() =>

  \n\nec.components\nThis project contains all sorts of angular components for creating data driven applications.\nIt is mainly used for entrecode admin applications in combination with the entrecode using ec.sdk.\nPackages\nMain Packages\n\n@ec.components/core: contains core typescript classes (no angular/datamanager)\n@ec.components/ui: contains core ui components (not datamanager specific)\n@ec.components/data: contains ui components for datamanager.\n@ec.components/style: contains styles for all components, built on x.ui.\n\nThe dependencies stack up from core to data (data > ui > core). You could also omit data, using just the ui components.\nOptional Packages\n\n@ec.components/calendar: contains calendar components, uses moment.\n@ec.components/location: wraps angular-google-maps.\n@ec.components/tinymce: wraps tinymce wysiwyg editor.\n@ec.components/medium-editor: wraps medium wysiwyg editor.\n@ec.components/ace: wraps ace code editor.\n\nDocumentation\nThe main documentation is located at entrecode.github.io/ec.components. You can find a getting started guide there.\nDemo\nA Demo is available at components.entrecode.de.\nDeveloping with Lerna + Yarn Workspaces\nThe repository is a monorepo, managed by lerna and yarn workspaces.\nAll folders inside dist + packages/style will be used as symlinks in node_modules/@ec.components/*.\nYou can update the symlinks by running yarn (e.g. after adding a new package).\nDev Setup\nAfter a fresh clone of the repo, run this:\nyarn install\nnpm run dev-setup\nnpm run startThe dev-setup script builds all packages and symlinks them to the node_modules.\nReleasing\nRun release task and select versions:\nnpm run releaseTo publish a new package for the first time, make sure you run npm publish --access=public before running lerna. See add-new-package for more info on creating a new package.\nAlso make sure to use Conventional Commits for proper changelogging.\nDefault README\nThis project was generated with Angular CLI version 7.2.1.\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:1337/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via Protractor.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI README.\nImpressum & Datenschutz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n

Upgrade Guide","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAngular7 update: BREAKING changes\nThe following breaking changes need to be considered when updating the components with angular 7. This update guide is just for @ec.components and angular 7. A whole angular 7 update guide can be found here.\nAngular 7 is used since the following versions:\n\n@ec.components/ace@0.6.0\n@ec.components/calendar@0.2.0\n@ec.components/core@0.19.0\n@ec.components/data@0.42.0\n@ec.components/location@0.18.0\n@ec.components/medium-editor@0.4.0\n@ec.components/style@0.21.0\n@ec.components/tinymce@0.5.0\n@ec.components/ui@0.36.0\n\nIt is recommended you use the most recent versions. Also add @ec.components/calendar to your package.json if you use datetime pipe or calendars / date pickers.\n1. All imports now go from the packages roots\nold:\nimport { EntryForm } from '@ec.components/data/src/entry-form/entry-form.component'new:\nimport { EntryForm } from '@ec.components/data'=> make sure you never import anything from src, since this folder no longer exists in the package\nPRO TIP\nUse VSCode \"Search: Replace in Files\" with the following Regex:\n\nSearch: _'@ec.components/(\\w+).*'_\nReplace: _'@ec.components/$1'_\n\n2. SCSS import changes\nold:\n@import '~@ec.components/style/components';new:\n@import '~@ec.components/style/scss/components';3. MediumModule has been renamed to MediumEditorModule\n4. Build Errors\nIf you are getting this:\nERROR in ./node_modules/eventsource/lib/eventsource.js\nModule not found: Error: Can't resolve 'http' in '/your-project/node_modules/eventsource/lib'\nERROR in ./node_modules/eventsource/lib/eventsource.js\nModule not found: Error: Can't resolve 'https' in 'your-project/node_modules/eventsource/lib'\nERROR in ./node_modules/jsonpath-plus/lib/jsonpath.js\nModule not found: Error: Can't resolve 'vm' in 'your-project/node_modules/jsonpath-plus/lib'To fix it, you need a custom webpack config. Eject is not available any more so we need to use angular-builders:\nnpm i @angular-builders/custom-webpack @angular-builders/dev-server @angular-devkit/build-angular --save-devThe following versions were used in this guide:\n\"@angular-builders/custom-webpack\": \"^7.2.0\",\n\"@angular-builders/dev-server\": \"^7.2.1\",\n\"@angular-devkit/build-angular\": \"^0.12.3\",In angular.json make following changes -\n\"architect\": {\n    \"build\": {\n        \"builder\": \"@angular-builders/custom-webpack:browser\",\n        \"options\": {\n        \"customWebpackConfig\": {\"path\": \"./custom-webpack.config.js\"},Notice change in builder and new option customWebpackConfig. Also change\n\"serve\": {\n    \"builder\": \"@angular-builders/dev-server:generic\",Now create a custom-webpack.config.js file in the root directory, containing:\nconst path = require(\"path\");\nmodule.exports = {\n    node: {\n        crypto: 'empty',\n        fs: 'empty',\n        http: 'empty',\n        https: 'empty',\n    }\n};Check this for more info.\nOther Problems you might run into\n\nCan't bind to 'ngModel' since it isn't a known property of 'input'\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/project-setup-tutorial.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/project-setup-tutorial.html","title":"additional-page - Project Setup Tutorial","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting up a new project with ec.components\nThis tutorial will show you how to set up a new project with the ec.components.\n1. Prequisites\nInstall angular-cli globally:\nnpm install -g @angular/cliThe following versions have been used for this tutorial:\n\n@angular/cli: 1.3.2\n@angular/animations: 4.3.6\n@angular/common: 4.3.6\n@angular/compiler: 4.3.6\n@angular/core: 4.3.6\n@angular/forms: 4.3.6\n@angular/http: 4.3.6\n@angular/platform-browser: 4.3.6\n@angular/platform-browser-dynamic: 4.3.6\n@angular/router: 4.3.6\n@angular/cli: 1.3.2\n@angular/compiler-cli: 4.3.6\n@angular/language-service: 4.3.6\ntypescript: 2.4.2\n\nYou can lookup your versions with ng --version\n2. Generate new Project\nng new ec-project --prefix ec-admin --routing true --style scssMake sure you replace ec-project with your project name and the prefix ec-admin with a project related shorthand symbol.\nMore info on the options for new.\n3. Install @ec.components/data\ncd ec-project\nyarn add @ec.components/data --save\nyarn add @ec.components/style --saveThis will install the data package which depends on ui and core packages.\nThe style package contains styles for ui and data.\n4. Import Styles\nInto your styles.scss, import the following styles:\n@import \"~xlcss/sass/xlcss.scss\";\n@import \"~x.ui/src/_config\";\n@import \"~x.ui/src/x.ui-sandbox.scss\";\n@import \"~@ec.components/style/components.scss\";5. Setup environment\nIn src/environments, you can find the different environment files.\nBy Default, there is a dev and a prod environment. For this tutorial, those two should be enough. We will use the dev environment for dev and staging and the prod environment for live. You could also add more environments, for more information, look here. \nsrc/environments/environment.ts:\nexport const environment = {\n  production: false,\n  environment: 'stage', // https://entrecode.github.io/ec.sdk/#environment\n  datamanagerID: 'XXXXXXXX', // datamanager shortID\n  clientID: 'my-dev-client' // your clientID\n};src/environments/environment.prod.ts:\nexport const environment = {\n  production: true,\n  environment: 'live', // https://entrecode.github.io/ec.sdk/#environment\n  datamanagerID: 'XXXXXXXX', // datamanager shortID\n  clientID: 'my-live-client' // your clientID\n};The .prod environment will be used when running ng build for production.\nThe client should use token method body. The callback URL does not matter.\n6. Add DataModule\nGo to src/app/app.module and add DataModule to your imports:\nimport { DataModule } from '@ec.components/data';\nimport { environment } from '../environments/environment';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    AppRoutingModule,\n    DataModule.forEnvironment(environment),\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }Here we are importing the DataModule along with the environment to then import it into our AppModule with the forEnvironment method.\n7. Add --ssl flag\nin your package.json, edit your start script to look like this:\n\"start\": \"ng serve --ssl\",Without the --ssl flag, the authorization won't work, because it enforces https.\n8. Add a component\ne.g. add to src/app/app.component.html:\nThis assumes that the model muffin exists inside the datamanager provided through your environment.\n9. Run the fun\nThats it! Now you can run the app using:\nnpm run startnow navigate to https://localhost:4200\n10. Add Notifications\nTo your app.component, you can add a global notification component, outside of your routing:\nThis will display all messages sent by the components or your own modules.\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/project-setup-tutorial/routes.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/project-setup-tutorial/routes.html","title":"additional-page - Routes","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding Routes\nThis short tutorial demonstrates how to quickly generate routes with components.\nIn the following tutorials, refer to this when you are called to create a new route.\n1. Create Component\nGenerate a new component\nng generate component muffinsAdd template to src/app/muffins/muffins.component.html\n2. Add a Route\nsrc/app/app-routing.module.ts:\nimport { MuffinsComponent } from './muffins/muffins.component';\n\nconst routes: Routes = [\n  {\n    path: '',\n    children: []\n  },\n  {\n    path: 'muffins',\n    component: MuffinsComponent\n  }\n];3. Run the Route\nNow you can access the muffin crud at https://localhost:4200/muffins\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/project-setup-tutorial/authorization.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/project-setup-tutorial/authorization.html","title":"additional-page - Authorization","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorization Flow\nThis Tutorial will show how to properly set up authorization with ec.components.\nMake sure you have a project running that follows the Setup Tutorial.\nLogin\n1. Create a new Route\nRefer to the routes tutorial. We create a route called login with a LoginComponent.\n2. Add route redirect to login.component.ts:\n  constructor(public router: Router) {\n  }\n\n  redirect() {\n    this.router.navigate(['profile'])\n  }3. Add Login Component to template\nUse this in your login.component.html template:\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/project-setup-tutorial/localization.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/project-setup-tutorial/localization.html","title":"additional-page - Localization","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocalization\nYou can setup localization via the SymbolService:\nimport en from './en';\n\n@Component({\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  constructor(private symbols: SymbolService) {\n   this.symbols.set(en);\n  }\n}It is expected that you pass an array of Symbol's to SymbolService#set\nDate Localization\nIf you are using datepickers, you have to include the following line to your root component:\nmoment.locale(this.symbols.resolve('moment.locale'));Using symbols in templates\nTo translate symbols in a template, use the symbol pipe:\n{{'symbol.language' | symbol}} Overwriting\nThe names of the symbols act as unique identifier, meaning you can overwrite any preexisting symbols. The default preexisting symbols of ec.components can be looked up here, or directly at the source: EN, DE\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/project-setup-tutorial/custom-fields-config.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/project-setup-tutorial/custom-fields-config.html","title":"additional-page - Custom Fields Config","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom Field Configuration\nRelated Doc:\n\nAll Possible field config properties\nDefault Type Config\nListConfig (also see ItemConfig parent)\nItem Doc\n\nExample\nYou can configure a models behaviour over the ModelConfigService.\nIt is recommended to configure a model in a parent component of all possible ec-crud lists or nested forms.\nSee the related doc links for default values / possible config values.\nexport class MuffinsComponent {\n  constructor(private modelConfig: ModelConfigService) {\n    moment.locale('de'); //set moment locale\n\n    this.modelConfig.set('muffin', {\n      fields: {\n        pictures: {\n          label: 'Bilder' //this label is shown above the form field and in the table header\n        },\n        name: {\n          label: 'Muffin Name',\n          group: (name) => {\n            return name[0].toUpperCase() //the return value is used to show group headers in a sorted list\n          },\n          required: true //when required, a new entry form cannot be saved without a value set for the field\n        },\n        _created: { //you can also access the system properties\n          label: 'Erstellt',\n          form: false, //this will hide the field inside the form\n          group: (value) => moment(value).format('YYYY')\n        },\n        amazement_factor: {\n          label: 'Amazement Faktor',\n          display: (value) => { //this will transform the value for output e.g. in a list cell\n            return (value * 10) + '%'\n          },\n          group: (value) => {\n            return value > 5 ? 'Größer als 50%' : 'Kleiner als 50%';\n          },\n          validate: (value) => { //this function will run when validating the value inside a form\n            if (typeof value !== 'number') {\n              return; //value is valid\n            }\n            if (value  10) {\n              return 'Darf maximal 10 sein';\n            }\n          }\n        },\n      }\n    });\n}\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/project-setup-tutorial/custom-entry-list.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/project-setup-tutorial/custom-entry-list.html","title":"additional-page - Custom Entry List","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nec-entry-list\nRelated Doc:\n\nAll Possible field config properties\nDefault Type Config\nListConfig (also see ItemConfig parent)\nItem Doc\n\nEntry Lists load multiple entries from a model and display them in a paginated list. It supports load error notifications, loader, filtering, sorting and automatic reloading + many customizations.\nDefault Usage\nThe above snippet will either consume the config for muffin in ModelConfigService, or if no config is found, generate one from the model schema.\nPassing a Config\nThe following snippet will assign the given config to the model/schema config:\ncolumnClicked output\nYou can react to column clicks via the columnClicked output:\nselect(item) {\n    console.log('entry',item.getBody(),item.id());\n}Seperated header/items/pagination markup\nIf you need a seperation of the list-header -items and -pagination, you can use the sub components of list.component:\n\n\n\n\nCreate Custom Cells via transform methods\nIf you want to custom cell values that do not require a custom markup, you can use transforms\ndisplay\nThe display transform method is used to display the value (say what?).\nIt is called from inside ec-output, which is used in list-cells and form readOnly fields.\nYou can change the display behaviour like this:\nthis.modelConfig.set('muffin', {\n    fields: {\n        amazement_factor: {\n            display: (value, item) => {\n                if(value===10) {\n                    return 'AMAZING!';\n                } else if(value > 7) {\n                    return 'amazing';\n                }\n                return 'not so amazing';\n            }\n        }\n    }\n});group\nYou can use grouping to get a clearer outline over sorted data:\nthis.modelConfig.set('muffin', {\n    fields: {\n        amazement_factor: {\n            group: (value, item) => {\n                if(value===10) {\n                    return 'AMAZING!';\n                } else if(value > 7) {\n                    return 'amazing';\n                }\n                return 'not so amazing';\n            }\n        }\n    }\n});The syntax is the same as for display but the result is used as a group label when the property is sorted.\nresolve\nThe value that is passed to the transform methods like display, group etc. can be changed beforehand with the resolve method. NOTE: the params are different than for the transform methods:\nthis.modelConfig.set('muffin', {\n    fields: {\n        amazement_factor: {\n            resolve: (body, item) => {\n                if(body.amazement_factor === -1) {\n                    return 0;\n                }\n                return body.amazement_factor;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n});this will also affect your forms!\npseudo properties via resolve\nYou can also define pseudo properties, meaning properties that do not exist on the original object:\nthis.modelConfig.set('muffin', {\n    fields: {\n        ranking: {\n            resolve: (body, item) => body.amazement_factor*body.flavour/body.price\n        }\n    }\n});This comes in handy when you want to display a often combined value out of multiple values.\nNOTE: pseudo properties should not be passed to the backend...\nCustom Cells via custom output component\nIf you want to custom cell values that do require a custom markup, you can use a custom output component:\nthis.modelConfig.set('muffin', {\n    fields: {\n        amazement_factor: {\n            output: StrongComponent\n        }\n    }\n});In your strong.component.ts, you can inherit OutputComponent, giving you access to the field and item of your cell:\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-strong',\n  template: `{{item.resolve(field.property)}}`\n})\nexport class StrongComponent extends OutputComponent {}NOTE: customizing the output component will also change the look of forms using that config, if the property is set readOnly.\nFiltering Lists\nBy default, each column that hosts a filterable property contains a search icon in its header. If the property is filterable is defined either by the field config (filterable) or falls back to the backend types that support filters. The search icon will open a pop with a field type specific filter input inside.\nCustom Filtering\nIf you do not want that (currently pretty clunky) pop filters, you can set filterable to false and manually call list.load with the desired filter:\n\n    show amazing muffins\n\nClicking the link will now show all muffins with exactly amazement_factor 10.\nCustom filter operators\nBy default, the entry-list will filter the property by its default filterOperator (see type config). If you want to change the default operator you can set it in the config:\nthis.modelConfig.set('muffin', {\n    fields: {\n        amazement_factor: {\n            filterOperator: 'from'\n        }\n    }\n});\n    show amazing muffins\n\nIf you now click the link, all muffins with amazement_factor>=5 will be loaded.\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/project-setup-tutorial/custom-entry-forms.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/project-setup-tutorial/custom-entry-forms.html","title":"additional-page - Custom Entry Forms","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntry Forms\nRelated Doc:\n\nAll Possible field config properties\nDefault Type Config\nListConfig (also see ItemConfig parent)\nItem Doc\n\nEntry forms can edit and create entries. They support notifications, loader, validation error handling and dynamic config generation out of the box.\nNOTE: it is expected you have placed a ec-notifications tag somewhere in your root component.\nDefault Behaviour\nCreate\nsubmitting the form will create a new entry and then switch to edit mode.\nEdit\nDynamic Edit/Create from template\nYou can also access the form from the template and call edit or create:\n\n\n    \n      {{muffin.name}}\n    \n  \nCreate new MuffinConfiguration\nIf nothing else is configured, the form will parse the schema of muffin and generate a generic field config.\nIf you configured the model via ModelConfigService (see Custom Fields), the form will use that config.\nAlternatively, you can also pass a config directly:\nThe given config will be Object.assigned to the possible preexisting modelConfig.\nCustom Markup with ec-input/ec-output\nMost times, you'll want more freedom over your forms markup etc. This is where ec-input and ec-output come into play:\n  \n    \n    Title\n        \n    \n    \n    Amazement Factor\n    \n    Submit\n  As soon as the ec-entry-form contains elements (or you pass empty=true, as meantioned below), the contents will be rendered instead of the default form.\nFeatures you have to add manually (if needed)\n\nsubmit button\nfield.readOnly handling (show ec-output instead of ec-input)\nlocal ec-loader\n\nNOTE: dont wrap labels around complex input components, because they fire ghost clicks!\nCustom input/output markup\nOf course you can remove another layer of abstraction to further customize the form:\n  \n    \n    Title\n    \n    \n    \n    Amazement Factor\n    {{form.display('amazement_factor')}}\n\n    Submit\n  Features you have to add manually:\n\nhandling of input errors (ec-input-errors)\nmaking sure your markup handles the field type correctly\nmaking sure your markup handles the field value correctly\n\nIt is generally recommended to use ec-input over hard coded forms.\nThe empty flag\nYou can also place the ec-input elements somewhere else and just tell the ec-entry-form that it shouldn't render the default form with the empty flag:\n\nNOTE: Always make sure the property accessed by ec-input is also present in your config (or you dont use a config at all). Otherwise, the input wont know what to render.\nCreating custom inputs\n1. Create Custom Input Component\nng g c custom-inputThis component will serve as a container for all possible custom input fields.\n2. Extend InputComponent (custom-input.component.ts)\nTo make the current field information available to the template, you need to extend InputComponent from @ec.components/ui:\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport { InputComponent } from '@ec.components/ui';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'clubapp-custom-input',\n  templateUrl: './custom-input.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./custom-input.component.scss']\n})\nexport class CustomInputComponent extends InputComponent {\n}CMD+Click on InputComponent to see which properties you can now use!\n3. Add Markup (custom-input.component.html)\nNow we can decide which custom input should be used, based on e.g. the fields view value:\n\n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n     -->\n  \nOf course you could also switch based on property name or type, depending on your application.\nThe id property of field is referenced in the label of the form. By adding it to the input makes sure your label click enters the input.\n4. Add CustomInputComponent to entryComponents:\nBecause the custom component will be loaded dynamically, your module needs to declare it as entryComponent:\n@NgModule({\n  entryComponents: [\n    CustomInputComponent\n  ]\n  /** more stuff **/\n})\nexport class AppModule {\n}5. Add CustomInputComponent to field config:\nNow you can add the Component as input to your field config:\nthis.modelConfig.set('muffin', {\n      fields: {\n        url: {\n          label: 'URL',\n          view: 'speakingurl',\n          input: CustomInputComponent\n        },\n        openingHours: {\n          label: 'Öffnungszeiten',\n          view: 'openingHours',\n          input: CustomInputComponent\n        }\n})By changing the view option, we can now decide which case will be met!\nCustom Form Controls\nNow what if you want to use a custom form control that does not rely on primitve inputs like number or text?\nIn the above custom-input.component template, we use  with a formControl input.\nTo have access to the form control's value, you need to provide a ControlValueAccessor:\nimport { Component, forwardRef } from '@angular/core';\nimport { ControlValueAccessor, NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR } from '@angular/forms';\nimport { InputComponent } from '@ec.components/ui';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'ec-opening-hours',\n  templateUrl: './opening-hours.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./opening-hours.component.scss'],\n  providers: [\n    {\n      provide: NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR,\n      useExisting: forwardRef(() => OpeningHoursComponent),\n      multi: true\n    }\n  ]\n})Now you can implement your own logic and call propagateChange when you change the value from your component, and react to change via the writeValue method!\nYou now could also use your component with ngModel or formControl in another context!\nMore information on this pattern: https://blog.thoughtram.io/angular/2016/07/27/custom-form-controls-in-angular-2.html\nCustom Fields without wrapper\nYou can also use custom components as input directly without needing to wrap them in \"CustomFieldsComponent\".\nJust make sure you implement ControlValueAccessor like above. When changes occur from the template, call propagateChange. You can react to outside model changes in writeValue.\nimport { Component, OnInit, Input } from '@angular/core';\nimport { InputComponent } from '../../../packages/ui';\nimport { ControlValueAccessor } from '@angular/forms';\n\n@Component({\n    selector: 'ec-counter',\n    templateUrl: './counter.component.html'\n})\n\nexport class CounterComponent extends InputComponent implements ControlValueAccessor {\n\n    value = 0;\n\n    increment() {\n        this.propagateChange(++this.value);\n    }\n\n    decrement() {\n        this.propagateChange(--this.value);\n    }\n\n    writeValue(value: any) {\n        this.value = value;\n        console.log('received value', value);\n    }\n\n    propagateChange = (_: any) => {\n    };\n\n    registerOnChange(fn) {\n        this.propagateChange = fn;\n    }\n\n    registerOnTouched() {\n    }\n\n}\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/readme.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/readme.html","title":"additional-page - README","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nec.components\nThis project contains all sorts of angular components for creating data driven applications.\nIt is mainly used for entrecode admin applications in combination with the entrecode using ec.sdk.\nPackages\nMain Packages\n\n@ec.components/core: contains core typescript classes (no angular/datamanager)\n@ec.components/ui: contains core ui components (not datamanager specific)\n@ec.components/data: contains ui components for datamanager.\n@ec.components/style: contains styles for all components, built on x.ui.\n\nThe dependencies stack up from core to data (data > ui > core). You could also omit data, using just the ui components.\nOptional Packages\n\n@ec.components/calendar: contains calendar components, uses moment.\n@ec.components/location: wraps angular-google-maps.\n@ec.components/tinymce: wraps tinymce wysiwyg editor.\n@ec.components/medium-editor: wraps medium wysiwyg editor.\n@ec.components/ace: wraps ace code editor.\n\nDocumentation\nThe main documentation is located at entrecode.github.io/ec.components. You can find a getting started guide there.\nDemo\nA Demo is available at components.entrecode.de.\nDeveloping with Lerna + Yarn Workspaces\nThe repository is a monorepo, managed by lerna and yarn workspaces.\nAll folders inside dist + packages/style will be used as symlinks in node_modules/@ec.components/*.\nYou can update the symlinks by running yarn (e.g. after adding a new package).\nDev Setup\nAfter a fresh clone of the repo, run this:\nyarn install\nnpm run dev-setup\nnpm run startThe dev-setup script builds all packages and symlinks them to the node_modules.\nReleasing\nRun release task and select versions:\nnpm run releaseTo publish a new package for the first time, make sure you run npm publish --access=public before running lerna. See add-new-package for more info on creating a new package.\nAlso make sure to use Conventional Commits for proper changelogging.\nDefault README\nThis project was generated with Angular CLI version 7.2.1.\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:1337/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via Protractor.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI README.\nImpressum & Datenschutz\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/readme/data-readme.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/readme/data-readme.html","title":"additional-page - data README","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@ec.components/data\nThis package contains all ec.datamanager related components.\nBeing wether framework agnostic nor backend agnostic, it is lowest fruit on the abstraction tree.\nIt extends the classes of the core module to create datamanager specific classes that are then used in the components.\nOverview\n\nModule Overview Page\nCHANGELOG\n\nInstallation\n1.
