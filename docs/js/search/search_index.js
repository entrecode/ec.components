represents a property of an Object, without a specific value.\nIt is used to describe a column or field of one or multiple equally structured objects.\nThe field config (see FieldConfigProperty) can contain different transformation methods, such as:\n\nresolve: This method is used to resolve the field value from the object body.\nIt runs before all other transformation methods.\ndisplay: Transforms the resolved value to a human readable output. It is used for e.g. in list cells.\ngroup: Should return a value that is suitable for grouping multiple different values together, like in a list.\n\nExample Usage:\nconst field = new Field('name', {\n    resolve: (body) => body.value.name,\n    display: (value) => value.toUpperCase(),\n    group: (value) => value.length + ' Buchstaben',\n    sort: (value) => value.length\n    });\nconst name = field.resolve({value:{name:'bobby'}}); // 'bobby'\nfield.display(name); // => 'Bobby'\nfield.group(name); // => '5 Buchstaben'\nfield.sort(name); // => 5The above example is of course only viable to show the concept.\nWhen using the components as a whole, those methods will be called automatically from Item, List or Form.\n\n    \n\n    \n        import { FieldConfigProperty } from '../config/field-config-property.interface';\n\nexport class Field implements FieldConfigProperty {\n  /** Tells if the field is required in forms */\n  required?: boolean;\n  /** The name of the field's property */\n  property?: string;\n  /** If true, the field will not be visible anywhere */\n  hidden?: boolean;\n  /** The field's type */\n  type?: string;\n  /** The field's view */\n  view?: string;\n  /** Custom Validation function */\n  validate?: (value, field) => any;\n  /** Custom Component to display form input **/\n  input?: any;\n  /** Custom Component to display value **/\n  output?: any;\n  /** Placeholder in inputs */\n  placeholder?: string;\n  /** Label for Inputs.

'Higher than 10m' : 'Lower than 10m'\n    },\n    fruits: {\n      label: 'Has Fruits?',\n      display: (value) => value ?

LoaderThe default classes can be found here.\nUsage\nYou can use a global loader that handles every action or use multiple local loaders:\nimport { LoaderComponent, LoaderService } from '@ec.components/ui';\nexport class MyApp {\n  @ViewChild('globalLoader') globalLoader: LoaderComponent;\n  @ViewChild('localLoader') localLoader: LoaderComponent;\n  constructor(private loaderService: LoaderService) {\n      this.loaderService.use(this.globalLoader); // set global loader\n  }\n  globalLoader() { // When not passing a loader to .wait, the global loader (set by .use) is used.\n    this.loaderService.wait(new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 2000)));\n  }\n  localLoader() {\n    this.loaderService.wait(new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 2000)), this.localLoader);\n    // this.localLoader.wait(new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 2000))); // alternative way\n  }\n}The advantage of local loaders is that you can place them in specific places of your template to only \"disable\" a part of your site while loading and not the whole page.\nSee the commented out line in localLoader for a direct way to trigger a loader without the service.\nHow it works\nEach time .wait is called on the LoaderService, the target loader throws the given promise on a stack. When all promises on the stack have been resolved, the loader is hidden. This is better than just a boolean switch because multiple loading activies do not interfere with each other.\n\n    \n\n    \n        import { Component, ElementRef, ChangeDetectionStrategy } from '@angular/core';\nimport { Collection } from '@ec.components/core/src/collection/collection';\n\n/** The ec-loader can be plugged into various components to be triggered when they load stuff.\n * https://components.entrecode.de/ui/loader?e=1\n*/\n@Component({\n  selector: 'ec-loader',\n  templateUrl: './loader.component.html',\n  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush\n})\nexport class LoaderComponent {\n  /** The current stack of loading promises.*/\n  private stack: Collection> = new Collection([]);\n  /** The loader's visibility status. */\n  private visible = false;\n  /** The timestamp of the last time a promise has been added to the stack. */\n  private timestamp;\n\n  /** Injects the host element. */\n  constructor(private host: ElementRef) {\n  }\n\n  /** Shows the loader by setting .visible to the host.

The classes that are available by default can be looked up here.\nAdvanced Usage\nYou can also use multiple ec-notifications at different places:\n\n\nA\nBAll you have to do, is pass the instance of the component that should display the notification via the host property:\nexport class MyComponent {\n  constructor(private notifications: NotificationsService) {}\n\n  emit(host) {\n      this.notifications.emit({\n        type: 'success',\n        title: 'Das ist der Notification Titel',\n        host: host\n      });\n  }\n}Hiding previous errors\nHere is an example usage of a typical success/error handling.\nIt features hiding previous notifications. We recommended you to use the WithNotifications interface for that case.\nexport class MuffinComponent implements WithNotifications {\n  /** Recent Error notification */\n  notifications: Notification[] = [];\n\nconstructor(\n    public bakery:BakeryService,\n    public notificationService: NotificationsService,\n    )\n\n  bake() {\n    this.bakery.bake().then(()=> {\n        this.notificationService.emit({\n            title: 'Muffin was baken!',\n            hide: this.notifications // this will hide all preceding notifications\n        })\n    }).catch(error=>{\n        this.notificationService.emit({\n            title: 'Error while baking',\n            sticky: true,\n            hide: this.notifications, // this will hide all preceding notifications\n            replace: this.notifications // this will replace the given array with the new notification\n        })\n    });\n  }\n}The hide option is useful to hide obsolete errors. E.g. If you successfully log in after one failiure, the sticky error notification of the first attempt will be hidden. This enables you to keep errors messages as long as they are needed.\nInstead of replace, you could also use append (see notification.component.ts for implementation).\n\n    \n\n    \n        import { Component, Input } from '@angular/core';\nimport { Collection } from '@ec.components/core/src/collection/collection';\nimport { Notification } from './notification';\nimport { NotificationsService } from './notifications.service';\n\n/** Displays any kind of Notification inside the DOM.\n * It listens on the notificationService.$emitter for notifications.\n * https://components.entrecode.de/ui/notifications?e=1\n * */\n@Component({\n  selector: 'ec-notifications',\n  templateUrl: './notifications.component.html',\n})\nexport class NotificationsComponent {\n  /** The current stack of notifications that are visible. */\n  notifications: Collection = new Collection([]);\n  /** The default time for a notification to be visible. Will be ignored if the notification itself has a time set. */\n  @Input() time: number;\n\n  /** Listens on the NotificationService and shows each notification that has this component set as host, or none at all. */\n  constructor(private notificationService: NotificationsService) {\n    this.time = this.time || this.notificationService.defaultTime;\n    this.notificationService.emitter$.subscribe((notification: Notification) => {\n      if (notification.hide) {\n        this.notifications.removeAll(notification.hide);\n      }\n      if (!notification.title && !notification.message) {\n        // console.warn('tried to emit notification without message and title', notification);\n        return;\n      }\n      if

notification.replace.push(notification);\n      }\n\n      if (!notification.host || notification.host === this) {\n        this.notifications.add(notification);\n        if (notification.sticky) {\n          if (notification.time) {\n            console.warn('notification.time is ignored because it was set sticky');\n          }\n          return;\n        }\n        setTimeout(() =>

Angular.\nModules\nThere are three main modules:\n\n*@ec.components/core*: contains core typescript classes (no angular, no datamanager)\n*@ec.components/ui*: contains core ui components (angular, no datamanager)\n*@ec.components/data*: contains ui components for datamanager (angular+datamanager)\n\nThe dependencies stack up from core to data (data > ui > core).\nThe packages sources are located at src/packages.\nThere is also a fourth module called ```*@ec.components/style*`.\nIt contains more sophisticated styles for ui components using x.ui.\nDocumentation\nThe main documentation is located at https://entrecode.github.io/ec.components/.\nYou can find a getting started guide there\nDemo\nA Demo is available at https://components.entrecode.de/.\nDevelopment\nThis project was generated with Angular CLI version 1.0.0-rc.0.\nLerna\nThe repository is a monorepo, managed by lerna.\nDeveloping with Symlinks\nThe start npm script will automatically use the symlinks from src/packages for @ec.components.\nIt also deletes eventually existing node_modules folders inside the packages.\nThis enables you to always use imports like: import  from '@ec.components/'.\nPublishing\n\nRun bootstrap task, this will call lerna bootstrap for core/ui/data packages and their prepublish scripts:npm run bootstrap\nRun publish task and select versions:npm run publish\n\nTo publish a new package, make sure you run npm publish --access=public before running lerna.\nMake sure you update the symlinks.sh and delete-modules.sh scripts to make it work for the demo server.\nImport Structure\nAll imports inside src/packages that import from the same package or another ec.components package must be relative.\n\nImports from the same package should always import the index file \"from '..'\"\nThis implies that all components/classes etc are placed inside a flat subfolder structure.\nThe relative path '..' therefore links to the index.ts where all package exports are defined.\n\n\nImports from another package should always import the relative path to the package index (e.g. ../../packages/core)\n\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory.\nUse the --env=prod or --env=stag for environment builds.\nCAUTION: you may have to \"es2015\" in tsconfig.json / lib to make UglifyJS work\nsee https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2/issues/659\nBuild Trouble Shooting\nErrors like this (or similar):\nERROR in ./node_modules/@ec.components/data/src/auth/auth.service.ts\nModule build failed: Error: /Users/kon/workspace/0.entrecode/nwb.admin/node_modules/@ec.components/data/src/auth/auth.service.ts is missing from the TypeScript compilation. Please make sure it is in your tsconfig via the 'files' or 'include' property.can be fixed by including the ec.components files explicitly (+excluding the test files):\n{\n  \"extends\": \"../tsconfig.json\",\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"outDir\": \"../out-tsc/app\",\n    \"baseUrl\": \"./\",\n    \"module\": \"es2015\",\n    \"types\": []\n  },\n  \"exclude\": [\n    \"test.ts\",\n    \"**/*.spec.ts\",\n    \"../node_modules/@ec.components/**/*.spec.ts\"\n  ],\n  \"include\": [\n    \"**/*.ts\",\n    \"../node_modules/@ec.components/**/*.ts\"\n  ]\n}Running unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via Protractor.\nBefore running the tests make sure you are serving the app via ng serve.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI README.\nImpressum & Datenschutz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n

Prequisites\nInstall angular-cli globally:\nnpm install -g @angular/cliThe following versions have been used for this tutorial:\n\n@angular/cli: 1.3.2\n@angular/animations: 4.3.6\n@angular/common: 4.3.6\n@angular/compiler: 4.3.6\n@angular/core: 4.3.6\n@angular/forms: 4.3.6\n@angular/http: 4.3.6\n@angular/platform-browser: 4.3.6\n@angular/platform-browser-dynamic: 4.3.6\n@angular/router: 4.3.6\n@angular/cli: 1.3.2\n@angular/compiler-cli: 4.3.6\n@angular/language-service: 4.3.6\ntypescript: 2.4.2\n\nYou can lookup your versions with ng --version\n2. Generate new Project\nng new ec-project --prefix ec-admin --routing true --style scssMake sure you replace ec-project with your project name and the prefix ec-admin with a project related shorthand symbol.\nMore info on the options for new.\n3. Install @ec.components/data\ncd ec-project\nyarn add @ec.components/data --save\nyarn add @ec.components/style --saveThis will install the data package which depends on ui and core packages.\nThe style package contains styles for ui and data.\n4. Import Styles\nInto your styles.scss, import the following styles:\n@import \"~xlcss/sass/xlcss.scss\";\n@import \"~x.ui/src/_config\";\n@import \"~x.ui/src/x.ui-sandbox.scss\";\n@import \"~@ec.components/style/components.scss\";5. Setup environment\nIn src/environments, you can find the different environment files.\nBy Default, there is a dev and a prod environment. For this tutorial, those two should be enough. We will use the dev environment for dev and staging and the prod environment for live. You could also add more environments, for more information, look here. \nsrc/environments/environment.ts:\nexport const environment = {\n  production: false,\n  environment: 'stage', // https://entrecode.github.io/ec.sdk/#environment\n  datamanagerID: 'XXXXXXXX', // datamanager shortID\n  clientID: 'my-dev-client' // your clientID\n};src/environments/environment.prod.ts:\nexport const environment = {\n  production: true,\n  environment: 'live', // https://entrecode.github.io/ec.sdk/#environment\n  datamanagerID: 'XXXXXXXX', // datamanager shortID\n  clientID: 'my-live-client' // your clientID\n};The .prod environment will be used when running ng build for production.\nThe client should use token method body. The callback URL does not matter.\n6. Add DataModule\nGo to src/app/app.module and add DataModule to your imports:\nimport { DataModule } from '@ec.components/data';\nimport { environment } from '../environments/environment';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    AppRoutingModule,\n    DataModule.forEnvironment(environment),\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }Here we are importing the DataModule along with the environment to then import it into our AppModule with the forEnvironment method.\n7. Add --ssl flag\nin your package.json, edit your start script to look like this:\n\"start\": \"ng serve --ssl\",Without the --ssl flag, the authorization won't work, because it enforces https.\n8. Add a component\ne.g. add to src/app/app.component.html:\nThis assumes that the model muffin exists inside the datamanager provided through your environment.\n9. Run the fun\nThats it! Now you can run the app using:\nnpm run startnow navigate to https://localhost:4200\n10. Add Notifications\nTo your app.component, you can add a global notification component, outside of your routing:\nThis will display all messages sent by the components or your own modules.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/project-setup-tutorial/routes.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/project-setup-tutorial/routes.html","title":"additional-page - Routes","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding Routes\nThis short tutorial demonstrates how to quickly generate routes with components.\nIn the following tutorials, refer to this when you are called to create a new route.\n1. Create Component\nGenerate a new component\nng generate component muffinsAdd template to src/app/muffins/muffins.component.html\n2. Add a Route\nsrc/app/app-routing.module.ts:\nimport { MuffinsComponent } from './muffins/muffins.component';\n\nconst routes: Routes = [\n  {\n    path: '',\n    children: []\n  },\n  {\n    path: 'muffins',\n    component: MuffinsComponent\n  }\n];3. Run the Route\nNow you can access the muffin crud at https://localhost:4200/muffins\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/project-setup-tutorial/authorization.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/project-setup-tutorial/authorization.html","title":"additional-page - Authorization","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorization Flow\nThis Tutorial will show how to properly set up authorization with ec.components.\nMake sure you have a project running that follows the Setup Tutorial.\nLogin\n1. Create a new Route\nRefer to the routes tutorial. We create a route called login with a LoginComponent.\n2. Add route redirect to login.component.ts:\n  constructor(public router: Router) {\n  }\n\n  redirect() {\n    this.router.navigate(['profile'])\n  }3. Add Login Component to template\nUse this in your login.component.html template:\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/project-setup-tutorial/localization.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/project-setup-tutorial/localization.html","title":"additional-page - Localization","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocalization\nYou can setup localization via the SymbolService:\nimport en from './en';\n\n@Component({\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  constructor(private symbols: SymbolService) {\n   this.symbols.set(en);\n  }\n}It is expected that you pass an array of Symbol's to SymbolService#set\nDate Localization\nIf you are using datepickers, you have to include the following line to your root component:\nmoment.locale(this.symbols.resolve('moment.locale'));Using symbols in templates\nTo translate symbols in a template, use the symbol pipe:\n{{'symbol.language' | symbol}} Overwriting\nThe names of the symbols act as unique identifier, meaning you can overwrite any preexisting symbols. The default preexisting symbols of ec.components can be looked up here, or directly at the source: EN, DE\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/project-setup-tutorial/custom-fields-config.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/project-setup-tutorial/custom-fields-config.html","title":"additional-page - Custom Fields Config","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom Field Configuration\nRelated Doc:\n\nAll Possible field config properties\nDefault Type Config\nListConfig (also see ItemConfig parent)\nItem Doc\n\nExample\nYou can configure a models behaviour over the ModelConfigService.\nIt is recommended to configure a model in a parent component of all possible ec-crud lists or nested forms.\nSee the related doc links for default values / possible config values.\nexport class MuffinsComponent {\n  constructor(private modelConfig: ModelConfigService) {\n    moment.locale('de'); //set moment locale\n\n    this.modelConfig.set('muffin', {\n      fields: {\n        pictures: {\n          label: 'Bilder' //this label is shown above the form field and in the table header\n        },\n        name: {\n          label: 'Muffin Name',\n          group: (name) => {\n            return name[0].toUpperCase() //the return value is used to show group headers in a sorted list\n          },\n          required: true //when required, a new entry form cannot be saved without a value set for the field\n        },\n        _created: { //you can also access the system properties\n          label: 'Erstellt',\n          form: false, //this will hide the field inside the form\n          group: (value) => moment(value).format('YYYY')\n        },\n        amazement_factor: {\n          label: 'Amazement Faktor',\n          display: (value) => { //this will transform the value for output e.g. in a list cell\n            return (value * 10) + '%'\n          },\n          group: (value) => {\n            return value > 5 ?

It supports load error notifications, loader, filtering, sorting and automatic reloading + many customizations.\nDefault Usage\nThe above snippet will either consume the config for muffin in ModelConfigService, or if no config is found, generate one from the model schema.\nPassing a Config\nThe following snippet will assign the given config to the model/schema config:\ncolumnClicked output\nYou can react to column clicks via the columnClicked output:\nselect(item) {\n    console.log('entry',item.getBody(),item.id());\n}Seperated header/items/pagination markup\nIf you need a seperation of the list-header -items and -pagination, you can use the sub components of list.component:\n\n\n\n\nCreate Custom Cells via transform methods\nIf you want to custom cell values that do not require a custom markup, you can use transforms\ndisplay\nThe display transform method is used to display the value (say what?).\nIt is called from inside ec-output, which is used in list-cells and form readOnly fields.\nYou can change the display behaviour like this:\nthis.modelConfig.set('muffin', {\n    fields: {\n        amazement_factor: {\n            display: (value, item) => {\n                if(value===10) {\n                    return 'AMAZING!';\n                } else if(value > 7) {\n                    return 'amazing';\n                }\n                return 'not so amazing';\n            }\n        }\n    }\n});group\nYou can use grouping to get a clearer outline over sorted data:\nthis.modelConfig.set('muffin', {\n    fields: {\n        amazement_factor: {\n            group: (value, item) => {\n                if(value===10) {\n                    return 'AMAZING!';\n                } else if(value > 7) {\n                    return 'amazing';\n                }\n                return 'not so amazing';\n            }\n        }\n    }\n});The syntax is the same as for display but the result is used as a group label when the property is sorted.\nresolve\nThe value that is passed to the transform methods like display, group etc. can be changed beforehand with the resolve method. NOTE: the params are different than for the transform methods:\nthis.modelConfig.set('muffin', {\n    fields: {\n        amazement_factor: {\n            resolve: (body, item) => {\n                if(body.amazement_factor === -1) {\n                    return 0;\n                }\n                return body.amazement_factor;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n});this will also affect your forms!\npseudo properties via resolve\nYou can also define pseudo properties, meaning properties that do not exist on the original object:\nthis.modelConfig.set('muffin', {\n    fields: {\n        ranking: {\n            resolve: (body, item) => body.amazement_factor*body.flavour/body.price\n        }\n    }\n});This comes in handy when you want to display a often combined value out of multiple values.\nNOTE: pseudo properties should not be passed to the backend...\nCustom Cells via custom output component\nIf you want to custom cell values that do require a custom markup, you can use a custom output component:\nthis.modelConfig.set('muffin', {\n    fields: {\n        amazement_factor: {\n            output: StrongComponent\n        }\n    }\n});In your strong.component.ts, you can inherit OutputComponent, giving you access to the field and item of your cell:\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-strong',\n  template: `{{item.resolve(field.property)}}`\n})\nexport class StrongComponent extends OutputComponent {}NOTE: customizing the output component will also change the look of forms using that config, if the property is set readOnly.\nFiltering Lists\nBy default, each column that hosts a filterable property contains a search icon in its header. If the property is filterable is defined either by the field config (filterable) or falls back to the backend types that support filters. The search icon will open a pop with a field type specific filter input inside.\nCustom Filtering\nIf you do not want that (currently pretty clunky) pop filters, you can set filterable to false and manually call list.load with the desired filter:\n\n    show amazing muffins\n\nClicking the link will now show all muffins with exactly amazement_factor 10.\nCustom filter operators\nBy default, the entry-list will filter the property by its default filterOperator (see type config). If you want to change the default operator you can set it in the config:\nthis.modelConfig.set('muffin', {\n    fields: {\n        amazement_factor: {\n            filterOperator: 'from'\n        }\n    }\n});\n    show amazing muffins\n\nIf you now click the link, all muffins with amazement_factor>=5 will be loaded.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/project-setup-tutorial/custom-entry-forms.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/project-setup-tutorial/custom-entry-forms.html","title":"additional-page - Custom Entry Forms","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntry Forms\nRelated Doc:\n\nAll Possible field config properties\nDefault Type Config\nListConfig (also see ItemConfig parent)\nItem Doc\n\nEntry forms can edit and create entries. They support notifications, loader, validation error handling and dynamic config generation out of the box.\nNOTE: it is expected you have placed a ec-notifications tag somewhere in your root component.\nDefault Behaviour\nCreate\nsubmitting the form will create a new entry and then switch to edit mode.\nEdit\nDynamic Edit/Create from template\nYou can also access the form from the template and call edit or create:\n\n\n    \n      {{muffin.name}}\n    \n  \nCreate new MuffinConfiguration\nIf nothing else is configured, the form will parse the schema of muffin and generate a generic field config.\nIf you configured the model via ModelConfigService (see Custom Fields), the form will use that config.\nAlternatively, you can also pass a config directly:\nThe given config will be Object.assigned to the possible preexisting modelConfig.\nCustom Markup with ec-input/ec-output\nMost times, you'll want more freedom over your forms markup etc. This is where ec-input and ec-output come into play:\n  \n    \n    Title\n        \n    \n    \n    Amazement Factor\n    \n    Submit\n  As soon as the ec-entry-form contains elements (or you pass empty=true, as meantioned below), the contents will be rendered instead of the default form.\nFeatures you have to add manually (if needed)\n\nsubmit button\nfield.readOnly handling (show ec-output instead of ec-input)\nlocal ec-loader\n\nNOTE: dont wrap labels around complex input components, because they fire ghost clicks!\nCustom input/output markup\nOf course you can remove another layer of abstraction to further customize the form:\n  \n    \n    Title\n    \n    \n    \n    Amazement Factor\n    {{form.display('amazement_factor')}}\n\n    Submit\n  Features you have to add manually:\n\nhandling of input errors (ec-input-errors)\nmaking sure your markup handles the field type correctly\nmaking sure your markup handles the field value correctly\n\nIt is generally recommended to use ec-input over hard coded forms.\nThe empty flag\nYou can also place the ec-input elements somewhere else and just tell the ec-entry-form that it shouldn't render the default form with the empty flag:\n\nNOTE: Always make sure the property accessed by ec-input is also present in your config (or you dont use a config at all). Otherwise, the input wont know what to render.\nCreating custom inputs\n1. Create Custom Input Component\nng g c custom-inputThis component will serve as a container for all possible custom input fields.\n2. Extend InputComponent (custom-input.component.ts)\nTo make the current field information available to the template, you need to extend InputComponent from @ec.components/ui:\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport { InputComponent } from '@ec.components/ui';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'clubapp-custom-input',\n  templateUrl: './custom-input.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./custom-input.component.scss']\n})\nexport class CustomInputComponent extends InputComponent {\n}CMD+Click on InputComponent to see which properties you can now use!\n3. Add Markup (custom-input.component.html)\nNow we can decide which custom input should be used, based on e.g. the fields view value:\n\n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n     -->\n  \nOf course you could also switch based on property name or type, depending on your application.\nThe id property of field is referenced in the label of the form. By adding it to the input makes sure your label click enters the input.\n4. Add CustomInputComponent to entryComponents:\nBecause the custom component will be loaded dynamically, your module needs to declare it as entryComponent:\n@NgModule({\n  entryComponents: [\n    CustomInputComponent\n  ]\n  /** more stuff **/\n})\nexport class AppModule {\n}5. Add CustomInputComponent to field config:\nNow you can add the Component as input to your field config:\nthis.modelConfig.set('muffin', {\n      fields: {\n        url: {\n          label: 'URL',\n          view: 'speakingurl',\n          input: CustomInputComponent\n        },\n        openingHours: {\n          label: 'Öffnungszeiten',\n          view: 'openingHours',\n          input: CustomInputComponent\n        }\n})By changing the view option, we can now decide which case will be met!\nCustom Form Controls\nNow what if you want to use a custom form control that does not rely on primitve inputs like number or text?\nIn the above custom-input.component template, we use  with a formControl input.\nTo have access to the form control's value, you need to provide a ControlValueAccessor:\nimport { Component, forwardRef } from '@angular/core';\nimport { ControlValueAccessor, NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR } from '@angular/forms';\nimport { InputComponent } from '@ec.components/ui';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'ec-opening-hours',\n  templateUrl: './opening-hours.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./opening-hours.component.scss'],\n  providers: [\n    {\n      provide: NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR,\n      useExisting: forwardRef(() => OpeningHoursComponent),\n      multi: true\n    }\n  ]\n})Now you can implement your own logic and call propagateChange when you change the value from your component, and react to change via the writeValue method!\nYou now could also use your component with ngModel or formControl in another context!\nMore information on this pattern: https://blog.thoughtram.io/angular/2016/07/27/custom-form-controls-in-angular-2.html\nCustom Fields without wrapper\nYou can also use custom components as input directly without needing to wrap them in \"CustomFieldsComponent\".\nJust make sure you implement ControlValueAccessor like above. When changes occur from the template, call propagateChange. You can react to outside model changes in writeValue.\nimport { Component, OnInit, Input } from '@angular/core';\nimport { InputComponent } from '../../../packages/ui';\nimport { ControlValueAccessor } from '@angular/forms';\n\n@Component({\n    selector: 'ec-counter',\n    templateUrl: './counter.component.html'\n})\n\nexport class CounterComponent extends InputComponent implements ControlValueAccessor {\n\n    value = 0;\n\n    increment() {\n        this.propagateChange(++this.value);\n    }\n\n    decrement() {\n        this.propagateChange(--this.value);\n    }\n\n    writeValue(value: any) {\n        this.value = value;\n        console.log('received value', value);\n    }\n\n    propagateChange = (_: any) => {\n    };\n\n    registerOnChange(fn) {\n        this.propagateChange = fn;\n    }\n\n    registerOnTouched() {\n    }\n\n}\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/ui.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/ui.html","title":"additional-page - UI","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUI Components Overview\nNow that the Core classes were discussed, lets have a look at its application in the ui components.\nThe ui components, which lay inside the ui package are all basic angular components.\nThey are API agnostic, meaning they do not contain any datamanager logic (or similar).\nAPI related components are meant to inherit from the base ui components to eliminate redundancies.\nInstallation\nnpm i @ec.components/uiDemo\nTBD:\n\nList\nCustom Cell Components\nTransform fields\n\n\nForm\nCustom Field Components\nInline Forms\n\n\nLogin\nPop\nTabs\nSelect\n\nNotifications\n\nLoader\nMenu\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/ui/icons.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/ui/icons.html","title":"additional-page - Icons","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIcon\nOpen Demo\nDisplays an icon:\nThe default icon set uses ec-icons. You have to embedd them to your index.html (or similar):\n  Using another icon set\nYou can also use other icons:\nimport { emojiIcons } from '@ec.components/ui/src/icon/emoji-icons';\nexport class SomeModule  {\n    constructor(public iconService: IconService) {\n        this.iconService.use(emojiIcons);\n    }\n}Overriding icons\nYou can also override the current icon registry:\nimport { emojiIcons } from '@ec.components/ui/src/icon/emoji-icons';\nexport class SomeModule  {\n    constructor(public iconService: IconService) {\n        this.iconService.set(emojiIcons);\n    }\n}This will override the icon registry with the given icons, but keep the rest.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/ui/notificationscomponent.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/ui/notificationscomponent.html","title":"additional-page - NotificationsComponent","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotifications\nThe Notifications Module is a combination of the NotificationsService and the NotificationsComponent.\nSimple Usage\n\nPlace the component somewhere in your app template:\n\n\nEmit notifications via the service\n\nexport class MyComponent {\n  constructor(private notifications: NotificationsService) {}\n\n  showNotification() {\n      this.notifications.emit({\n        type: 'success',\n        title: 'Das ist der Notification Titel',\n        message: 'Das ist die Beschreibung'\n      });\n  }\n\n  doSomethingRisky() {\n      return Promise.reject('Fehler')\n      .catch((err) => {\n          this.notifications.emit({\n              error: err, // passing the error Object\n              title: 'Fehler!'\n          })\n      })\n  }\n}The given type will be added as class. The classes that are available by default can be looked up here.\nAdvanced Usage\nYou can also use multiple ec-notifications at different places:\n\n\nA\nBAll you have to do, is pass the instance of the component that should display the notification via the host property:\nexport class MyComponent {\n  constructor(private notifications: NotificationsService) {}\n\n  emit(host) {\n      this.notifications.emit({\n        type: 'success',\n        title: 'Das ist der Notification Titel',\n        host: host\n      });\n  }\n}Hiding previous errors\nHere is an example usage of a typical success/error handling.\nIt features hiding previous notifications. We recommended you to use the WithNotifications interface for that case.\nexport class MuffinComponent implements WithNotifications {\n  /** Recent Error notification */\n  notifications: Notification[] = [];\n\nconstructor(\n    public bakery:BakeryService,\n    public notificationService: NotificationsService,\n    )\n\n  bake() {\n    this.bakery.bake().then(()=> {\n        this.notificationService.emit({\n            title: 'Muffin was baken!',\n            hide: this.notifications // this will hide all preceding notifications\n        })\n    }).catch(error=>{\n        this.notificationService.emit({\n            title: 'Error while baking',\n            sticky: true,\n            hide: this.notifications, // this will hide all preceding notifications\n            replace: this.notifications // this will replace the given array with the new notification\n        })\n    });\n  }\n}The hide option is useful to hide obsolete errors. E.g. If you successfully log in after one failiure, the sticky error notification of the first attempt will be hidden. This enables you to keep errors messages as long as they are needed.\nInstead of replace, you could also use append (see notification.component.ts for implementation).\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/ui/loadercomponent.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/ui/loadercomponent.html","title":"additional-page - LoaderComponent","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoader\nThe loader can be used to indicate any kind of loading activity\nTemplate\n\n\nGlobal Loader\nLocal LoaderThe default classes can be found here.\nUsage\nYou can use a global loader that handles every action or use multiple local loaders:\nimport { LoaderComponent, LoaderService } from '@ec.components/ui';\nexport class MyApp {\n  @ViewChild('globalLoader') globalLoader: LoaderComponent;\n  @ViewChild('localLoader') localLoader: LoaderComponent;\n  constructor(private loaderService: LoaderService) {\n      this.loaderService.use(this.globalLoader); // set global loader\n  }\n  globalLoader() { // When not passing a loader to .wait, the global loader (set by .use) is used.\n    this.loaderService.wait(new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 2000)));\n  }\n  localLoader() {\n    this.loaderService.wait(new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 2000)), this.localLoader);\n    // this.localLoader.wait(new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 2000))); // alternative way\n  }\n}The advantage of local loaders is that you can place them in specific places of your template to only \"disable\" a part of your site while loading and not the whole page.\nSee the commented out line in localLoader for a direct way to trigger a loader without the service.\nHow it works\nEach time .wait is called on the LoaderService, the target loader throws the given promise on a stack. When all promises on the stack have been resolved, the loader is hidden. This is better than just a boolean switch because multiple loading activies do not interfere with each other.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/ui/listcomponent.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/ui/listcomponent.html","title":"additional-page - ListComponent","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nList\nThe List is one of the main components to work with.\nThe basic idea is to display collections of data in a structured but flexible way.\nYou can create a new List like this:\nthis.trees = new List(\n//first argument: Array of Objects\n[{\n  name: 'Appletree',\n  height: 10,\n  fruits: true\n}, {\n  name: 'Lemontree',\n  height: 8,\n  fruits: true\n}, {\n  name: 'Birch',\n  height: 20,\n  fruits: false\n}],\n//second (optional) argument: ListConfig\n{\n  fields: {\n    name: {\n      label: 'Name'\n    },\n    height: {\n      label: 'Height',\n      group: (h) => h > 10 ?

It is used for e.g. in list cells.\ngroup: Should return a value that is suitable for grouping multiple different values together, like in a list.\n\nExample Usage:\nconst field = new Field('name', {\n    resolve: (body) => body.value.name,\n    display: (value) => value.toUpperCase(),\n    group: (value) => value.length + ' Buchstaben',\n    sort: (value) => value.length\n    });\nconst name = field.resolve({value:{name:'bobby'}}); // 'bobby'\nfield.display(name); // => 'Bobby'\nfield.group(name); // => '5 Buchstaben'\nfield.sort(name); // => 5The above example is of course only viable to show the concept.\nWhen using the components as a whole, those methods will be called automatically from Item, List or Form.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/core-classes/item.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/core-classes/item.html","title":"additional-page - Item","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem\nThe foundation for all entities is the Item class.\nIt consists of a body (value) and a config (see ItemConfig).\nIt can be used with arbitrary body values but is mainly thought to be a wrapper for objects.\nPrimitive use:\nconst primitive = new Item('a');\nprimitive.resolve();

Create folder in packages\nCreate a new folder, e.g. mkdir packages/medium-editor\n2. init npm\ncd packages/medium-editor && npm init\n\nMake sure to name the package scoped: ```@ec.components/*`\nAdd dependencies according to your needs, e.g. angular etc.\n\n3. Create src folder\nCreate a src folder and add your super cool typescript code.\n\nMake sure your package.json main file is correct.\nMake sure you have all dependencies up to date.\n\n4. add package to symlinks.sh\n\nAdd your package name to the symlinks script.\n\n5. add package to delete-modules.sh script\n\nAdd your package name to the delete-modules script.\n\n6. add package to main package.json dependencies\n\nKeep version up to date (or use * as wildcard)\nrun npm i\n\n7. add package to lerna.json\n\nThis integrates the package to the bootstrap/publish cycle of lerna.\n\n8. Manually Publish package the first time\nBefore being able to publish with lerna, you have to publish it manually the first time:\nnpm publish --access=publicsee https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/access#details.\n9.
